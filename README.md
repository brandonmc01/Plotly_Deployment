# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive website that allows for easy exploration of a dataset comprised of the microbes colonizing human belly buttons.

The dashboard shows:
- A dropdown menu allowing a user to select their subject ID number. This will filter the dataset to just show results for that participant.
- A display showing demographic info for the selected participant.
- A bar chart showing the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the selected participant's navel.
- A gauge chart showing the number of times the participant washes their navel per week.
- A bubble chart showing all bacterial cultures found, and their frequency. 
- When hovering over the bar chart, and bubble chart, a popup will show exact frequency as well as the bacteria's name.
